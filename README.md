# Managing Software Complexity Manifesto

- **Start Simple, Refactor Often**  
  Design is iterative. Your first approach won’t be perfect—refactor frequently to improve simplicity and flexibility.

- **Minimize Entanglement**  
  Keep code modular and independent. Avoid tight coupling between components, as it complicates future changes.

- **Write Readable Code**  
  Code is for people to read and maintain. Strive for clarity; if it's hard to understand, it's too complex.

- **Unit Tests Empower Refactoring**  
  Tests give you the confidence to refactor safely. They allow you to make changes without the fear of breaking your system.

- **Single Responsibility**  
  Functions and classes should do one thing well. This reduces complexity and improves maintainability.

- **Don't over plan**
